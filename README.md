## A Sample App to calculate the Animal Age in various formats

The goal of this application was to learn how to code on Swift for macOS and to share sample, functional code for those in the Mac programming community to use and reference for use in their own desktop applicaitons. 

The app itself is located on the macOS App Store, again as a proof of concept and more or less as a portfolio piece.

The UI was designed in Photoshop and the App was originally coded in Objective-C and ported over to Swift.
